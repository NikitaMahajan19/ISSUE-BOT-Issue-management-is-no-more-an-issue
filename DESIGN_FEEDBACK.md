| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |

| <tr><th colspan=3> Setup </th></tr> |
| **Problem Stmt** | 12.5/15 | problem statement is missing the key phrase:  "The problem is...". <br><br>Additionally, I'm not sure I buy this: "Issue management through GitHub in the lifecycle involves manual intervention in notifying stakeholders of their pending issues..."   because github has a notification struction when as issues is assigned or mentions someone.  |
| **Bot Description** | 8.0/10 | which chat platform is the bot developed for? |
| **Use Cases** | 15.0/15 | NOTE THIS IS FEEDBACK YOU PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED<br /><br />You have a start on your Use Cases, but they need Revisions:    UCs -- change the names to include verbs.   UC3 EC should include invalid (or future) dates. Otherwise No concerns about your use cases.  Well done.  Please proceed with Bot.md. |
| **Wireframes** | 15.0/15 | Good job |
| **Storyboard** | 15.0/15 | Good job |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 25.0/30 | Unclear about the role of the database in the architecture. Does it serve as a cache for the bot to fetch data instead of making API calls to GitHub, or does it contain some metadata about the issues in the GitHub repository? In either scenario, how is consistency between the database and the main repository maintained? The use cases do not mention the use of a database, and the architecture description just provides a general description of the DB Handler.<br><br>Is that diagram provided in Additional Design Patterns fundamentally any different than the main architecture diagram? |
